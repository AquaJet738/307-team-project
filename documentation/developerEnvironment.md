# How to Setup your Environment to Contribute

### Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Install npm if necessary
3. Run 'npm install all' to install all the necessary packages
4. Run npm start in the root to start the backend and frontend

You will also need to create a .env file with the right credentials, but we cannot provide you those here.
